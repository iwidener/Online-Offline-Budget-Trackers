### As a developer <br>
### I want to create an app for an avid traveller <br>
### that will allow to add expenses and deposits to the budget with or without a connection. <br>

## Description
* The user will be able to manage the budget with or without access to the Internet.<br>
* The feautures of PWA allow to enter transactions offline. They should populate the total when being brought back online. It will help the user to keep the account balance being accurate and updated. 

### Offline Functionality:
* Enter deposits offline
* Enter expenses offline

### Online Functionality
* Offline entries should be added to a tracker.
